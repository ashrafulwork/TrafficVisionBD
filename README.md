## 🚀 What I'm Working On  

### **TrafficVisionBD**  
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing traffic elements such as:  
- Vehicles 🚗  
- Traffic signs 🛑  
- Intersections 🚥  
- Jaywalking 🚶‍♂️  
- Illegal parking 🚫  

#### **Current Focus**  
- Data collection and annotation (over 20,000 images and diverse datasets).  

#### **Future Goal**  
- Develop and deploy a **real-time traffic management system** using deep learning models and computer vision techniques.

## 🎥 Demo Videos (Inspiration from Researchers/Creators)  
Here are some demo videos that align with the objectives of this project and provide valuable insights into the technologies and approaches I plan to use:  

1. **[Jaywalking Detection using AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7g7elewctk)**  
   - Demonstrates AI for detecting jaywalking, a key aspect of **TrafficVisionBD**.  
   - Helps improve traffic safety by identifying pedestrians crossing roads illegally or in unsafe areas.  

2. **[Vehicle Count at Junctions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJG3pRjNH7Q)**  
   - Shows how many cars pass through a particular junction.  
   - Crucial for traffic flow analysis and adjusting traffic signals for better management.  

---

## 🎯 What I Aim to Achieve  
Through **TrafficVisionBD**, I aim to:  
- Enable **real-time vehicle detection** and traffic analysis.  
- Improve **safety and efficiency** in urban traffic management.  
- Build **AI-driven systems** that adapt to dynamic road conditions and provide real-time traffic solutions.

## 🛠️ Technologies We Use  
This project integrates four key areas of AI:  
1. **Machine Learning**  
2. **Deep Learning**  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
4. **Computer Vision**  

By combining these technologies, **TrafficVisionBD** aims to create a comprehensive solution for traffic management in Bangladesh.
